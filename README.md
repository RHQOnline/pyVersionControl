## Raison D'Ãªtre
The Python Developer User-Space is currently lacking of a consistent, stable, and performant auto-updater or software launcher. This is a rather large hole in the community that, in our opinion, needs to be addressed. This repository and it's contents serve as a one-size-fits-all solution to this issue, allowing users to have access to a cross-platform, performant auto-updating library to be built into their own applications, or to build a launcher and updater around an existing application.

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/RHQOnline/pyVersionControl` or head to the [Releases](https://github.com/RHQOnline/pyVersionControl/releases/latest) page and grab the latest version.

## Usage
This section details usage for the library, the (upcoming) GUI Launcher, and the Tools.

### Hosting
A webserver and/or GitHub repository will be required for this utility to function. You will need to be able to point the Updater to the host `.json` file with the data it needs to determine if an update is needed and, if so, fetch and save or patch the update. You can generate a ready-to-go version of this `.json` file by using the [JSON Generator](https://github.com/RHQOnline/pyVersionControl/blob/main/tools/json_generator.py) (more details below).

Example Endpoints:
- `https://www.mysite.com/host.json`/`127.0.0.1:5000/host.json` (webserver)
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourUsername/YourRepo/main/your.json` (GitHub)

### `auto_updater.py`
- Drag'n'Drop `auto_updater.py` into your `/src` directory or your project directory
- Import it via `from auto_updater import AutoUpdater`
- Create the `AutoUpdater` Object by Initializing it: `updater = AutoUpdater(json_link = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourUsername/YourRepo/main/your.json", version = "1.0.0", binaryfile = True, newfile = False, buffer_size = 65536, verbose = False)`
- Call the Update Task with `updater.attempt_update()`
- Enjoy! :)

#### Parameters for the `AutoUpdater()` Object
|    Parameter     |    Default Value    |       Description        |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| json_link        | 127.0.0.1/host.json | The Link to Your Remote .json Host / Status File |
| version          | 1.0.0 | The Version of Your Application |
| binaryfile | True | If `True`, Makes Downloaded File Executable on Unix Systems; If `False` Does Nothing |
| newfile          | True | If `True`, Creates New File for Updated Application; If `False`, Overwrites Existing Application |
| buffer_size | 65536 | Size of the Buffer (in Bytes) for Reading / Writing Files |
| verbose | False | Verbosity Toggle (Detailed Output in Terminal of Update Task) |

### JSON Generator (`json_generator.py`)
 - CD / ChDir into `/tools`
 - Run `json_generator.py` as a Script or Binary File
   - Example (Script Usage): `python json_generator.py`
   - Example (Binary Usage): `./json_generator` (Linux / MacOSX) or `json_generator.exe` (Windows)

#### Fields for the JSON Generator
|        Field         |     Description     |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Application Name     | The Name of your Application |
| Version              | The Version of your Application |
| Information          | Misc. Release Notes, Link to Changelog, etc. |
| Include Windows      | Yes to Include Windows Files and Data, No to Leave "N/A" in Place |
| Include Unix         | Yes to Include Unix Files and Data, No to Leave "N/A" in Place |
| File Path            | Path (Absolute or Relative) to the Release File (for Obtaining Hash and Size Data)|
| Download Link        | Link to the Release |
| Downloaded File Name | Name of the File to be Set on Download |

### `hasher.py` and `sizer.py`
**DEPRECATED** in favor of the [JSON Generator](https://github.com/RHQOnline/pyVersionControl/blob/main/tools/json_generator.py), but still usable.
- CD / ChDir into `/tools`
- Run `hasher.py` or `sizer.py` with the desired file as the only argument
  - Example (Script Usage): `python hasher.py ../dist/my_app.exe`
  - Example (Binary Usage): `./sizer dist/my_app` (Linux / MacOSX) or `sizer(.exe) dist/my_app.exe` (Windows)

#### Arguments for `hasher.py` and `sizer.py`
| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| filename | Absolute or Relative File Path to Desired File |

## Features

   - Exists Standalone from Launchers
   - Plug'n'Play with Pre-Existing Applications
     - Drop `auto_updater.py` into your sources for your program
     - `from auto_updater import AutoUpdater`
     - `updater = AutoUpdater()` to Create the Object (use parameters)
     - `updater.attempt_update()` to Spawn Task for Update Check
   - Users don't have to manually download your new builds any more
 - Hashing and File Sizing Utilities
   - This is so users can properly update their host `.json` file
   - See the [Tools](https://github.com/RHQOnline/pyVersionControl/tree/main/tools) Directory

## Roadmap
 - Implement Error and Exception Handling
 - Build GUI Version for Launcher (Template)
 - Branch Support for Updates (Nightly/Stable/Dev)
   - Optional: Password Protect Branches (like Dev)
   - This allows developers to have a rolling-release model
     - Users can opt for "Stable" to recieve less / more infrequent updates
 - Add Parameter to Updater to Decide Offline Functionality
   - Based on the type of application, the developer may want different functionalities if an internet connection isn't present
   - Two Choices
     - Stop Working as a Whole without Internet
     - Allow Update to Skip if No Internet Connection
