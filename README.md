# pyVersionControl - FOSS VCS and Launcher / Updater!
pyVersionControl is a cross-platform, Python-based TUI/GUI Application/Client Launcher and Updater, with an included library to drop into your existing applications for ease of implementation!

## Raison D'Ãªtre
The Python Developer User-Space is currently lacking of a consistent, stable, and performant auto-updater or software launcher. This is a rather large hole in the community that, in our opinion, needs to be addressed. This repository and it's contents serve as a one-size-fits-all solution to this issue, allowing users to have access to a cross-platform, performant auto-updating library to be built into their own applications, or to build a launcher and updater around an existing application.

## Features
 - TUI/GUI Launcher Builds (customisable)
   - Ready-to-Go, Configurable Launchers
   - Basic, but Highly Extensible
 - Auto-Updating Ability / Package
   - Exists Standalone from Launchers
   - Plug'n'Play with Pre-Existing Applications
   - Users don't have to manually download your new builds any more
 - Full Cross-Platform Support
   - Linux
   - Windows (x32, x64)
   - MacOS

## Roadmap
TBA. This is Day 0 of Development.
